# Introduction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. The HistGradientBoostingClassifier algorithm from the scikit-learn library is used for this task, which is a gradient boosting-based ensemble method optimized for large datasets.

# Requirements
To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
sci-kit-learn
pandas
NumPy
You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install sci-kit-learn pandas numpy

# Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (if not already installed) using the command mentioned in the Requirements section.
Place the Titanic dataset (CSV format) in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

# Data

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. Kindly refer to the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file

The dataset has the following columns:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger

Survived: The target variable (0 - Did not survive, 1 - Survived)

Pclass: Ticket class (1 - First class, 2 - Second class, 3 - Third class)

Name: Name of the passenger

Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female)

Age: Age of the passenger

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Ticket: Ticket number

Fare: Passenger fare

Cabin: Cabin number

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C - Cherbourg, Q - Queenstown, S - Southampton)
